Repository that holds my attempts at solutions to the well known S-99 Scala problems.

Link: http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

To download Scala: http://www.scala-lang.org/download/

To compile and run these solutions:

```
scalac p01.scala
# After compilation
scala
# Launch the Scala shell
P01.last(List(1,2,3,4))
# Result should be 4
```
